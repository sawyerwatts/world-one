# world-one

This repo is a rebuild/iteration on [sf0.org](sf0.org) that a friend and I
discussed and briefly attempted a couple years ago. My friend plays `sf0`, which
is essentially an ARG (not the virtual reality kind) mixed with a social media.
I'm revisiting this project for funsies.

## Developer Setup

1. Run `source ./env` to prompt and source needed environment variables and
aliases. This will require supplemental environment variables, like `PSUSER`,
so developers should set those environemt variables into `.env`, which is
excluded from source control.

## TODO

### GitHub

- Create ci/cd pipeline and have it pad PRs

### Application

- Eras
- Factions
- Players + Characters
    - B2C auth
- Etc
